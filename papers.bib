  abstract      = {We study automorphisms of order four on K3 surfaces. The
                  symplectic ones have been first studied by Nikulin, they
                  are known to fix six points and their action on the K3
                  lattice is unique. In this paper we give a classification
                  of the purely non-symplectic automorphisms by relating the
                  structure of their fixed locus to their action on
                  cohomology, in the following cases: the fixed locus
                  contains a curve of genus g>0; the fixed locus contains at
                  least a curve and all the curves fixed by the square of the
                  automorphism are rational. We give partial results in the
                  other cases. Finally, we classify non-symplectic
                  automorphisms of order four with symplectic square.},

  abstract      = {This paper is the first part of a project aimed at
                  understanding deformations of triangulated categories, and
                  more precisely their dg and A infinity models, and applying
                  the resulting theory to the models occurring in the
                  Homological Mirror Symmetry setup. In this first paper, we
                  focus on models of derived and related categories, based
                  upon the classical construction of twisted objects over a
                  dg or $A_{\infty}$-algebra. For a Hochschild 2 cocycle on
                  such a model, we describe a corresponding "curvature
                  compensating" deformation which can be entirely understood
                  within the framework of twisted objects. We unravel the
                  construction in the specific cases of derived A infinity
                  and abelian categories, homotopy categories, and categories
                  of graded free qdg-modules. We identify a purity condition
                  on our models which ensures that the structure of the model
                  is preserved under deformation. This condition is typically
                  fulfilled for homotopy categories, but not for unbounded
                  derived categories.},

                  that there is a mathematical community that works together
                  to advance mathematical knowledge. Using a single story as

                  2 for general curves of genus 11, and describe explicitly

@Article{         gritsenko10,
  abstract      = {{The name "K3 surfaces" was coined by A. Weil in 1957 when
                  he formulated a research programme for these surfaces and
                  their moduli. Since then, irreducible holomorphic
                  symplectic manifolds have been introduced as a higher
                  dimensional analogue of K3 surfaces. In this paper we
                  present a review of this theory starting from the
                  definition of K3 surfaces and going as far as the global
                  Torelli theorem for irreducible holomorphic symplectic
                  manifolds as recently proved by M. Verbitsky. For many
                  years the last open question of Weil's programme was that
                  of the geometric type of the moduli spaces of polarised K3
                  surfaces. We explain how this problem has been solved. Our
                  method uses algebraic geometry, modular forms and Borcherds
                  automorphic products. We collect and discuss the relevant
                  facts from the theory of modular forms with respect to the
                  orthogonal group O(2,n). We also give a detailed
                  description of quasi pull-back of automorphic Borcherds
                  products. This part contains previously unpublished
                  results. We apply our geometric-automorphic method to study
                  moduli spaces of both polarised K3 surfaces and irreducible
                  symplectic varieties.}},

                  ideal I_t(\cA) generated by the maximal minors of a
                  homogeneous presentation matrix, \cA, of M has maximal
                  codimension in R). Suppose X:=Proj(R/I_t(\cA)) is smooth in
                  a sufficiently large open subset and dim X > 0. Then we
                  prove that the local graded deformation functor of M is
                  isomorphic to the local Hilbert (scheme) functor at X
                  \subset Proj(R) under a week assumption which holds if dim
                  X > 1. Under this assumptions we get that the Hilbert
                  scheme is smooth at (X), and we give an explicit formula
                  for the dimension of its local ring. As a corollary we
                  prove a conjecture of R. M. Mir\'o-Roig and the author that
                  the closure of the locus of standard determinantal schemes
                  with fixed degrees of the entries in a presentation matrix
                  is a generically smooth component V of the Hilbert scheme.
                  Also their conjecture on the dimension of V is proved for
                  dim X > 0. The cohomology H^i_{*}({\cN}_X) of the normal
                  sheaf of X in Proj(R) is shown to vanish for 0 < i < dim
                  X-1. Finally the mentioned results, slightly adapted,
                  remain true replacing R by any Cohen-Macaulay quotient of a

                  particular, when the ambient space is a smooth projective

                  spaces are irreducible and carry natural virtual
                  fundamental classes. We also prove a version of the
                  Skolem-Noether theorem for certain algebra objects in the
                  derived category, which allows us to give an explicit

                  a positive-characteristic version of the Torelli theorem
                  that uses the derived category in place of the Hodge

                  Shioda-supersingular K3 surface is uniquely determined up

                  structure in algebraic cohomology theories (etale,

                  function of a K3 surface is a derived invariant (discovered
                  independently by Huybrechts); 2) the variational

                  established by Elkies to show that Mordell-Weil rank 18
                  over Q is impossible for an elliptic K3 surface. We then
                  apply our methods to general singular K3 surfaces, i.e.
                  with Neron-Severi group of rank 20, but not necessarily

                  nonnegative integer, and $\beta \neq 0$ in
                  $H_{2}(S,\mathbb{Z})$ a curve class. We construct a derived
                  stack
                  $\mathbb{R}\bar{\mathbf{M}}^{\textrm{red}}_{g}(S;\beta)$
                  whose truncation is the usual stack
                  $\bar{\mathbf{M}}_{g}(S;\beta)$ of stable maps from curves
                  of genus g to S hitting the class \beta, and such that the
                  inclusion $\bar{\mathbf{M}}_{g}(S;\beta)\hookrightarrow
                  \mathbb{R}\bar{\mathbf{M}}^{\textrm{red}}_{g}(S;\beta)$
                  induces on $\bar{\mathbf{M}}_{g}(S;\beta)$ a perfect
                  obstruction theory whose tangent and obstruction spaces
                  coincide with the corresponding reduced spaces of
                  Okounkov-Maulik-Pandharipande-Thomas. The approach we
                  present here yields not only a full rigorous proof of the
                  existence of a reduced obstruction theory, not relying on
                  any result on semiregularity maps, but also a new global
                  geometric interpretation. An important ingredient of our
                  construction is a perfect determinant map from the stack of
                  perfect complexes to the stack of line bundles whose
                  tangent morphism is Illusie's trace map for perfect
                  complexes. We expect that this determinant map might be
                  useful in other contexts as well.},
